# Stock Price Prediction using LSTM Neural Networks
Project 4 - Machine Learning

# Project Proposal
The aim of our project is to uncover the patterns in the stock market with the purpose of predicting future performance. Specifically in the healthcare sector. We will examine previous stock market performance to indicate future performance.

# Introduction
The objective of this project is to predict the stock prices for the next 30 days of the top healthcare companies using machine learning. The chosen model for this prediction is based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). The LSTM model is particularly suitable for sequential data like time-series, making it a valuable choice for predicting stock prices over time.
